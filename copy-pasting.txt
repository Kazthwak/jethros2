Which files are copy pasted
kernel.c	- two checks for cross compiler are copy-pasted, rest is not
boot.s		- mostly copy-pasted
kernel.asm	- not copy-paste
linker.ld	- copy-pasted
isodir		- copy-pasted
font.h		- font dowloaded from github. Author - Marcel Sondaar. Public domain
idt.c + isr.c	- mostly copied but not copy-pasted.
interupts.c	- copy-pasted, but any actual interupt handlers are mine
disk.c		- drivers unforgivably copy-pasted, writing my own drivers is high on the priority list.
the rest are not copy-pasted (barring the odd phrase and from myself)
bran's kernel development tutorial and the OSdev wiki have provided enourmous help
