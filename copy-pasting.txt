Which files are copy pasted
kernel.c	- two checks for cross compiler are copy-pasted, rest is not
boot.s		- mostly copy-pasted
kernel.asm	- not copy-pasted
linker.ld	- copy-pasted
isodir		- copy-pasted
font.h		- font dowloaded from github. Author - Marcel Sondaar. Public domain
the rest are not copy-pasted (barring the odd phrase and from myself)
bran's kernel development tutorial and the OSdev wiki have provided enourmous help
